            Under the dual action of migratory inputs from the countryside and natural increase, the region of Dakar has developed very rapidly. It has thus grown from 400,000 inhabitants in 1970 to 3.6 million inhabitants in 2018, an increase of nearly 5% per year. Macrocéphale metropolis, it welcomes half of the urban population of the country.
            
            Its situation at the western end of Africa, on the narrow peninsula of Cape Verde, favored the settlement of the first settlers, then the trade with the New World, and gives it a privileged position to intersection of African and European cultures. Organizer of the first World Festival of Negro Arts wanted by President Léopold Sédar Senghor in 1966, the city is home to the Fundamental Institute of Black Africa and the Central Bank of West African States.
            
            Today the Dak'Art (Biennale of Contemporary Art) contributes to its international influence. Popular neighborhoods and infrastructures inherited from the colonial era - the port, the train station, the presidential palace or the Cathedral of the African Remembrance, as well as the remarkable heritage of the nearby island of Gorée - have been added to more modern buildings. such as the Sheikh-Anta-Diop University, the Grand Mosque, the Third Millennium Gate and the African Renaissance Monument.
            
            Occupying only 0.28% of the national territory, the region of Dakar gathers on 550 km2, 25% of the population and concentrates 80% of the economic activities of the country3.
